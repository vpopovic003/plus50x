<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In soccer’s World Cup, the knockout round consists of 16 teams. In each round, each team plays another team and the losing teams are eliminated. When only two teams remain, the winner of the final match is the champion.</p>

<p>In soccer, teams are given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings#Current_calculation_method">FIFA Ratings</a>, which are numerical values representing each team’s relative skill level. Higher FIFA ratings indicate better previous game results, and given two teams’ FIFA ratings, it’s possible to estimate the probability that either team wins a game based on their current ratings. The FIFA Ratings from two previous World Cups are available as the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank/id12189/">May 2018 Men’s FIFA Ratings</a> and <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/women/rank/ranking_20190329/">March 2019 Women’s FIFA Ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Using this information, we can simulate the entire tournament by repeatedly simulating rounds until we’re left with just one team. And if we want to estimate how likely it is that any given team wins the tournament, we might simulate the tournament many times (e.g. 1000 simulations) and count how many times each team wins a simulated tournament.</p>

<p>Your task in this lab is to do just that using Python!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<div class="alert" data-alert="primary" role="alert"><p>Started CS50x in 2021 or prior and need to migrate your work from CS50 IDE to the new VS Code codespace? Be sure to check out our instructions on how to <a href="../../new/">migrate</a> your files!</p></div>

<p>Open <a href="https://code.cs50.io/">VS Code</a>.</p>

<p>Start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> by itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Click inside of that terminal window and then execute</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2021/fall/labs/6/world-cup.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>followed by Enter in order to download a ZIP called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">world-cup.zip</code> in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!</p>

<p>Now execute</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>unzip world-cup.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to create a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">world-cup</code>. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rm world-cup.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.</p>

<p>Now type</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd world-cup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>world-cup/ $
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all was successful, you should execute</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and you should see the following files:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2018m.csv  2019w.csv  tournament.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!</p>

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>

<p>Start by taking a look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2018m.csv</code> file. This file contains the 16 teams in the knockout round of the 2018 Men’s World Cup and the ratings for each team. Notice that the CSV file has two columns, one called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">team</code> (representing the team’s country name) and one called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code> (representing the team’s rating).</p>

<p>The order in which the teams are listed determines which teams will play each other in each round (in the first round, for example, Uruguay will play Portugal and France will play Argentina; in the next round, the winner of the Uruguay-Portugal match will play the winner of the France-Argentina match). So be sure not to edit the order in which teams appear in this file!</p>

<p>Ultimately, in Python, we can represent each team as a dictionary that contains two values: the team name and the rating. Uruguay, for example, we would want to represent in Python as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"team": "Uruguay", "rating": 976}</code>.</p>

<p>Next, take a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2019w.csv</code>, which contains data formatted the same way for the 2019 Women’s World Cup.</p>

<p>Now, open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tournament.py</code> and see that we’ve already written some code for you. The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> at the top represents how many World Cup simulations to run: in this case, 1000.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_game</code> function accepts two teams as inputs (recall that each team is a dictionary containing the team name and the team’s rating), and simulates a game between them. If the first team wins, the function returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>; otherwise, the function returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_round</code> function accepts a list of teams (in a variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code>) as input, and simulates games between each pair of teams. The function then returns a list of all of the teams that won the round.</p>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> function, notice that we first ensure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(sys.argv)</code> (the number of command-line arguments) is 2. We’ll use command-line arguments to tell Python which team CSV file to use to run the tournament simulation. We’ve then defined a list called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code> (which will eventually be a list of teams) and a dictionary called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> (which will associate team names with the number of times that team won a simulated tournament). Right now they’re both empty, so populating them is left up to you!</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>, we sort the teams in descending order of how many times they won simulations (according to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code>) and print the estimated probability that each team wins the World Cup.</p>

<p>Populating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> and writing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_tournament</code> function are left up to you!</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h2>

<p>Complete the implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tournament.py</code>, such that it simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning.</p>

<p>First, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>, read the team data from the CSV file into your program’s memory, and add each team to the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">The file to use will be provided as a command-line argument. You can access the name of the file, then, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sys.argv[1]</code>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Recall that you can open a file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open(filename)</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename</code> is a variable storing the name of the file.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Once you have a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code>, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csv.DictReader(f)</code> to give you a “reader”: an object in Python that you can loop over to read the file one row at a time, treating each row as a dictionary.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">By default, all values read from the file will be strings. So be sure to first convert the team’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code> to an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> (you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> function in Python to do this).</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Ultimately, append each team’s dictionary to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code>. The function call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams.append(x)</code> will append <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> to the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teams</code>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Recall that each team should be a dictionary with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">team</code> name and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_tournament</code> function. This function should accept as input a list of teams and should repeatedly simulate rounds until you’re left with one team. The function should the return the name of that team.</p>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">You can call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_round</code> function, which simulates a single round, accepting a list of teams as input and returning a list of all of the winners.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Recall that if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> is a list, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(x)</code> to determine the length of the list.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You should not assume the number of teams in the tournament, but you may assume it will be a power of 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, back in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> function, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> tournament simulations, and keep track of how many times each team wins in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> dictionary.</p>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">For example, if Uruguay won 2 tournaments and Portugal won 3 tournaments, then your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> dictionary should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"Uruguay": 2, "Portugal": 3}</code>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You should use your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulate_tournament</code> to simulate each tournament and determine the winner.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Recall that if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> is a dictionary, then syntax like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts[team_name] = x</code> will associate the key stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">team_name</code> with the value stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code> keyword in Python to check if a dictionary has a particular key already. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if "Portugal" in counts:</code> will check to see if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Portugal"</code> already has an existing value in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counts</code> dictionary.</li>
</ul>
